# Odoo - Docker

This is the result of a final degree work to correctly implement and maintain Odoo for the aUPaEU educational project.  

It is a complete example, so you can see how the credentials are finally set up, but in a real environment, as it is obvious, some files should not be made public.  

The most remarkable thing is the development of a series of scripts that make Odoo maintenance much easier, being especially useful if used in conjunction with GitHub Actions.
